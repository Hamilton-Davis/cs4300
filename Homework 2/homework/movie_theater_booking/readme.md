# Project Setup Instructions

This guide will walk you through the steps to run my project on devedu. You can either follow the instructions step-by-step or jump directly to the command section if you prefer.

### Prerequisites

- **Container Name**: `hdavis9`
- **Project Directory**: You need to access the `homework` directory (Note: it is not named `homework2` due to programming issues encountered during development).
- **Environment Setup**: You'll need to activate the virtual environment and run the server.
