This is my readme, which will walk you through how to run my code. In order to run my project on devedu, my container name is hdavis9. You can read below, but also skip past the reading and I have listed the commands. After the commands are images of the thing working.

In order to run my project on devedu, my container name is hdavis9. You need to access the directory of ‘homework’. (It is not named homework 2 due to errors I ran into while programming.) then go deeper into movie_theater_booking, after which you need to run
 source myenv--system-site-packages/bin/activate to simulate the environment, once this is complete run python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 in order to run the server. 

During my work on this project, I have used chat gpt to figure out the structure of the program as well as figure out how testing works, not gonna lie not much of help on the testing side.
.(Main reason for using this, I didn’t know much about the commands during the creation of this.) Here is the link: https://chatgpt.com/share/67c7c40e-9f00-8008-89cf-7de68fc6f19c 














COMMANDS TO RUN PROGRAM
cd homework
cd movie_theater_booking
source myenv--system-site-packages/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000


Below is my walking through creating a movie, doing the seating and doing the bookings.
