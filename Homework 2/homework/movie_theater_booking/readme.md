# Project Setup Instructions

This guide will walk you through the steps to run my project on devedu. You can either follow the instructions step-by-step or jump directly to the command section if you prefer.

### Prerequisites

- **Container Name**: `hdavis9`
- **Project Directory**: You need to access the `homework` directory (Note: it is not named `homework2` due to programming issues encountered during development).
- **Environment Setup**: You'll need to activate the virtual environment and run the server.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd homework
   cd movie_theater_booking
   source myenv--system-site-packages/bin/activate
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   Access the Server: Open the following link in your browser to view the application: https://editor-hdavis9-5.devedu.io/proxy/8000/
   Alternatively, use the port that appears after running the server.


# Acknowledgements
    During the development of this project, I used ChatGPT to help me understand the structure of the program and troubleshoot testing issues. While ChatGPT was useful for understanding commands, it wasn't as helpful with testing.
